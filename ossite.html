  <h2> OS: Operating Systems. </h2>

 
 <ul>

  <li> An Operating System is the software that manages computer hardware and software resources, which allows programs
  to run and interact with the hardware. It kinda acts as a bridge between users and the machine, making it possible for devices to function smoothly.</li>
 
  <li> The four most common operating systems are Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.</li>
 
  <li><b> Proprietary OS:</b> So a proprietary OS is owned and controlled by a single company or entity, with the source code kept secret. Users must pay for licenses to use it, and the company that owns the OS controls all updates, features, and support. 
   Windows and macOS are examples of proprietary OS.</li>

  <li><b> Open-Source OS:</b> However, an open-source OS is freely available to the public, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute its source code. This openness enables developers to contribute to the OS's improvement and customization.
  Linux is a well-known example.</li>

 </ul>
