 <p><b> User Interface (UI)</b></p>
<ul>
 <li> Windows provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the system through windows, icons, menus, and pointers. 
  This interface facilitates tasks like launching applications, managing files, and configuring settings.</li>
</ul>

 <p><b> Process and Memory Management</b></p>
<ul>
 <li> Windows efficiently manages the execution of multiple applications simultaneously (multitasking) by allocating system resources and memory to each process. 
  It ensures that active applications have the necessary resources while maintaining overall system stability.</li>
</ul>

  <p><b> Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)</b></p>
<ul>
 <li> Windows efficiently manages the execution of multiple applications simultaneously (multitasking) by allocating system resources and memory to each process. 
  It ensures that active applications have the necessary resources while maintaining overall system stability.</li>
